* TO DO *

Maybe we need to rework this.

Loop through the content and clean
Disregard anything not in the statement section
See what we have and go from there



isDoubleNarrative - checks whether narrative stretches to other row
inflateBalance - Sets balance against statement record
inflateDebitOrCredit - Sets the debit/credit in statement record

processPdfData - Takes the PDF data and output and spits out the CSV


*Bugs*

Credit card PDFs can't be converted
