* Auto detect debit and credit from transaction
* Ask for start balance and set balance
* Set the date for each field
* Add colour




Goal
Jan statements
 - transactions - 29

Steps

Phase 1 - Goal output the statement records to csv NO merging
* Loop through and extract all of text nodes
* Have a mapper for x co-ordinates and statement entry


Phase 1 - Tidy up
* Working tests
* Co-pilot to tidy the code

Phase 2 - Get the merging working

Bug

{
  date: '3.0810',
  transaction: '6.8130',
  narrative: '8.5190',
  debit: '22.975',
  credit: '23.256',
  balance: '32.837'
}

I think, if there is a balance row the mapping changes urgh

x = 23.256 = debit when balance is set at x = 32.837

credit should be at 27.438 when balance

Fix
  1. use transaction type in mapper to determine
  2. Have another mapper key debit with balance
